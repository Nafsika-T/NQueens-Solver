# N-Queens Java Visualizer

This project is a Java-based implementation and visualization of the classic **N-Queens problem**. The goal is to place `N` queens on an `N x N` chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

The application includes both the algorithmic solution and a graphical representation to help visualize the queen placements on the board.

## Features

- Solves the N-Queens problem using backtracking.
- Visual representation of the board and queen placements.
- Step-by-step display of solutions.
- Clean, object-oriented design.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

## How to Compile and Run

1. **Compile the project**:

   Open a terminal or command prompt in the project folder and run:
